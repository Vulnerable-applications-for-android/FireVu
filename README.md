# FireVu

FireVu is an intentionally vulnerable Android application developed for Android open source security. The initial goal was to demonstrate the misconfigured Firebase database of mobile apps. Later I have added a few vulnerabilities.

You can find out the following vulnerabilities in this app:

#1. Misconfigured Firebase backend.
#2. Vulnerable Exported content .
#3. Vulnerable Exported activities.
#4. Insecure data storage.
#5. Insecure logging.
